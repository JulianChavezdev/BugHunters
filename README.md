🛡️ BugHunters - Cybersecurity Landing Page
===========================================

> **"We Eliminate Bugs Before They Impact Your Business"**

This repository contains the source code for the corporate landing page of **BugHunters**, a high-level cybersecurity firm. The project stands out for its "Cyber/Tech" aesthetic and its focus on absolute visual stability.

📌 Project Description
----------------------

The goal of this development was to create an interface that conveys **solidity, security, and advanced technology**. Unlike standard fluid design trends, BugHunters was built under a philosophy of **High-Fidelity Static Design**.

This technical decision ensures the visual experience is identical, pixel-by-pixel, on target screens (desktop monitors and high-resolution presentations), avoiding the visual compromises that often come with excessive adaptability.

🚀 Key Features
---------------

### 🔒 "Zero-Responsive" Design

-   **Forced width of 1400px:** Ensures design integrity without unexpected shifts.

-   **Controlled horizontal scroll:** Enabled for smaller devices, prioritizing full information visualization without collapsing elements into "hamburgers" or stacked columns.

### 🎨 Cyberpunk/Security Aesthetic

-   **Color Palette:** *Deep Navy* (#1D3270), *Dark Royal Blue* (#1E3A8A), and *Neon Green* (#00D068).

-   **Typography:** Strategic use of **Orbitron** for brand identity and **Roboto** for technical readability.

-   **Immersive UI:** Stylized video frames, solid shadows ("flat shadows"), and high-contrast hover states.

🛠️ Technologies Used
---------------------

A pure stack, dependency-free, focused on performance and code clarity.

-   **Semantic HTML5:** Clear and accessible structure.

-   **CSS3:**

    -   Total layout control without frameworks (Bootstrap/Tailwind).

    -   Use of variables and simplified BEM methodology.

    -   Google Fonts import.

-   **Cloudinary:** CDN for optimized delivery of high-quality multimedia assets.
